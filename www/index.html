<H3><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H3>
<P>Profiling is an art, an art that it is very hard to master. Writing
micro-benchmarks is one of the many tools available to programmers
today. Micro-benchmarks are simple benchmarks that rarely involve
complicated deployments and are often used to test specific parts
of an application. They are also characterized by the use of
wall-clock blocks: start a clock, run the code, stop the clock
and report the result.</P>
<P> The lack of common tools for writing micro-benchmarks makes comparing
results published by different people impractical. Questions such
as "When did you start/stop the clock?" or "What exactly did you
include in the wall-clock block?" or "Are you reporting latency
or throughput?" often arise.</P>
<P>Japex is a simple yet powerful tool to write Java-based micro- benchmarks.
It started as simple project over a year ago, primarily aimed at testing
XML and Fast Infoset performance, but has evolved in to a
rather sophisticated framework with support for XML and HTML output as
well as various types of charts for displaying the results. It is  similar
in spirit to <a href="http://www.junit.org>JUnit</a> in that if factors out most of the repetitive
programming logic that is necessary to write in micro-benchmarks. This
logic includes loading and initializing multiple drivers, warming up the
VM, timing the inner loop, etc. One of the key design goals for 
Japex was extensibility. Via the use
of a simple model of input and output parameters, it is possible to
write micro-benchmarks to test practically anything.</P>
