Japex JUnit Sample
------------------

Running: 

 Ensure that JAPEX_HOME is set to point to the Japex distribution 
 directory. Update line 4 in build.xml to include the set of 
 properties that corresponds to your platform (see properties.*
 files) and then simply type,

 >> ant run
 
 See native-config.xml for an example on how to use the JDSL
 native driver located in com.sun.japex.jdsl.nativecode.

 See src/*.c for a template of a native Japex driver.
 Note that the functions runLoopIterations() and
 runLoopIterations() are implemented in native code to 
 avoid crossing the JNI layer while timing the test. These
 two functions should be part of the driver, and should be
 just copied from the templates. The parameter 'libraryName'
 is used in a Japex config file to load the library that
 implements a native driver. All native drivers define the 
 same set of symbols, but no clashes occur since
 Japex loads each driver in a separate class loader, and
 thus a separate name space.

 Note that when running Japex on Unix servers, it is necessary
 to export the DISPLAY variable on the server's session in 
 order for JFreeChart to render the charts generated by Japex. 
 If the server does not host an X server session (and most 
 servers don't) you'll need to find a workstation to which 
 you can point the DISPLAY variable to or use Xvfb.
