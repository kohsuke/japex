Japex Sample
------------

Running: 

 Ensure that JAPEX_HOME is set to point to the Japex distribution 
 directory. And,

 >> ant -Dconfig=... run
 
 where "..." stands for any of the configuration files '*-config.xml'.
 
 Note that when running Japex on Unix servers, it is necessary
 to export the DISPLAY variable on the server's session in order for
 JFreeChart to render the charts generated by Japex. If the server
 does not host an X server session (and most servers don't) you'll
 need to find a workstation to which you can point the DISPLAY 
 variable to or use Xvfb.
